  dialogueText: "The night air is thick and cold as you return to the village. The
    wind carries the sound of chanting \u2014 low, rhythmic, and wrong. Ahead, in
    the village square, firelight dances wildly. The townsfolk are gathered in a
    circle, their faces painted with ash, their voices blending into a single fevered
    prayer. At the center stands the tavern keeper, his eyes glazed, his hands clutching
    a crimson artifact that glows with a heartbeat of its own."
